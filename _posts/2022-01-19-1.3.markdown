Release [1.3][release] of Equations is available, as source and through `opam` packages
for Coq 8.13, 8.14 and 8.15. See the [release][release] notes and updated [reference manual][refman] for details.
This new major version cleans up the input syntax (allowing to use less ";"), makes the interpretation of patterns more robust
(disallowing dangerous shadowings) and better preserves user-given names by the `dependent elimination` and `funelim` 
tactics for more robust proof scripts.
